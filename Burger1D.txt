This a version of the Burger Solver in one-dimension.

1) An upwind scheme is used for the discretization of the numerical flux.

2) A second order Runge-Kutta time scheme is used for time stepping

 The two-stage Runge-Kutta (RK) method below 
 belongs to a family of RK methods which preserve TVD property under
 CFL certain conditions.


       Integral of the flux over each cell surface
       Finite Volume Equation is va[n+1] = va[n] + (dt/dx)*F      

	Conservative Form:
	------------------ 
	U_j[n+1] = U_j[n] - (dt/dx)[F(U[n];j) - F(U[n];j-1)]


	time stepping by 2nd order Runge-Kutta:
	---------------------------------------
	UP_j[n+1/2] = U_j[n] - (dt/2*dx)[F(U[n];j) - F(U[n];j-1)]      (predictor)
 
	U_j[n+1] = U_j[n] - (dt/dx)[F(UP[n+1/2];j) - F(UP[n+1/2];j-1]  (corrector)
                                                             


Burger equation: describe the propagation of a non-linear wave.
   u_t u*u_x = nu*u_xx 

   This equation is a simplification of the mechanical fluid equations. These
   equations describe the balance between the different forces. In this case convective 
   force and diffusive force. 

Terminology: 
			 u_t -> time derivative of the function u
			 u_x -> first derivative of the function u
             u_xx -> second derivative of the function u

	Physical meaning (force):
			 u*u_x  : convection force (non-linear)
			 nu*u_xx: diffusive force

where nu represent viscosity.

This equation develop a shock when 
unbalance between the convective effect (force) and the diffusive force (nu tend toward zero), 

it the develop a shock.
Non-homogeinity of the matter, strong gradient.
